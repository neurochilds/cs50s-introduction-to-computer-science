Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The lower the number of simulations, the greater the likelihood that a given team would be ranked higher or lower than it's FIFA ranking would dictate.
The predictions most likely to be incorrect at low a low number of simulation were those with FIFA rankings similar to other teams.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10,000. The increase in prediction accuracy between 1000 and 10000 simulations was considerable, while the increase in runtime only negligible.
In contrast, above 10,000 simulations, the increase in accuracy was negligible while the increase in run time becomes noticeable.
