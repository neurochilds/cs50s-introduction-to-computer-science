Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A: Their average energy was 0.65906, average valence 0.484443 and average danceability 0.71646. Accordingly, I would characterize their aura as Purple.
This is due to their comparatively high score for average danceability and energy.

Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A: This method weights all songs equally, regardless of the time spent listening to them. A better way to calculate the score would be to use an average that is weighted by time spent listening to each song.
With such a method, the energy, valence and danceability of a song that took up 5% of their total listening time would contribute 5% towards the averages for energy, valence and readaibility,
